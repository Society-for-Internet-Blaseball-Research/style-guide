# SIBR Style Guide

Please follow this guide for all publications and outreach issued by SIBR. External works that reference SIBR data 
and resources do not need to follow this guide, but we recommend it.

## Typography

The logo font is [DIN Condensed Bold](https://github.com/govex/govex.github.io/tree/master/fonts/din-condensed).

## Pronouns

Use the pronouns preferred by the referent. Use the singular "they", and avoid the "he/she" construct.

List the pronouns of the authors after their name in parentheses in all academic papers ("Corvimae (she/her)").

## Names

Refer to Discord usernames using the at-hash format (`@corvimae#8392`). Use the spelling and capitalization preferred by
the individual regardless of prescriptive grammar.

## Referring to SIBR

The full name of SIBR is the Society for Internet Blaseball Research. Do not capitalize "for". Do not capitalize "the" unless
at the beginning of a sentence.

Shorten "Society for Internet Blaseball Research" to either "SIBR" or "the Society". In academic contexts, prefer the use of small
caps for "SIBR".

## Referring to blaseball

"blaseball" is lowercase when referring to the splort itself. When referring to "Internet League Blaseball", always capitalize "Blaseball".

When shortening "Internet League Blaseball" to "ILB" in academic contexts, prefer the use of small caps.
